values left in the file (besides the one in this introduction of course).

Perfect Numbers
---------------
Q1: How many numbers does the program search through? How many perfect
numbers does it find? What are these perfect numbers?
A1: 39999, 4, 分别是6，28，496，8128

Q2: Search Size and Runtime for Exhaustive Algorithm
A2:
Search Size: 20000 	Runtime: 0.486 secs
Search Size: 40000 	Runtime: 1.908 secs
Search Size: 80000	Runtime: 7.397 secs
Search Size: 160000	Runtime: 29.13 secs
Search Size: 320000	Runtime: 115.176 secs
Search Size: 640000	Runtime: 445.834 secs

（doubling the size of the search doesn't just cause the time required to also double;
it goes up by a factor of 4. Rather than a linear relationship, we've got a quadratic relationship
between the search size and the program execution time）

(optional) Plot these values on a graph of runtime vs. Search size and
see if you can find a trend in the graph.


Q3: Does it take the same amount of work to evaluate the isPerfect algorithm
on the number 10 as it does on the number 1000? Why or why not? Does it 
take the same amount of work for the findPerfects algorithm to search
the range of numbers from 1-1000 as it does to search the numbers from 
1000-2000? Why or why not?
A3: isPerfect(1000) takes more time than isPerfect(10)
no


Q4: Make a prediction of how long it would take the exhaustive algorithm
to reach the 5th perfect number.
A4: TODO


Q5: Introduce a bug into the divisorSum function. Do any of the tests still
pass even with this broken function? Why or why not?
A5: TODO


Q6: Can the test framework detect that the test case is "bogus" in the sense
that the premise of the test case itself is off-base?(expect(isPerfect(5))
A6: it can't


Q7: Describe your testing strategy to determine that smarterSum was working
as expected.
A7: TODO


Q8: Search Size and Runtime for Smarter Search
A8:
Search Size: 20000 	Runtime: 0.047 secs
Search Size: 40000 	Runtime: 0.076 secs
Search Size: 80000	Runtime: 0.163 secs
Search Size: 160000	Runtime: 0.393 secs
Search Size: 320000	Runtime: 0.956 secs
Search Size: 640000	Runtime: 2.704 secs

(optional) Plot these values on a graph of runtime vs. search size and
see if you can find a trend in the graph.


Q9: How long will the optimized code take to reach the fifth perfect number?
A9: TODO


Q10: What test cases did you use to verify that your new function works correctly?
Please give a brief description of your testing strategy.
A10: TODO


Soundex
-------
Q11: What is the Soundex code for "Bowman"? What is the Soundex code for your own surname?
A11: TODO


Q12: Please describe your general decomposition strategy for implementing
the Soundex code generation algorithm.
A12: TODO


Q13: Think about one or more examples of a class of names that the Soundex system
might not work well for. Explain what this class of names is and why the system might
incorrectly group them or mis-categorize one of the names.
A13: TODO
